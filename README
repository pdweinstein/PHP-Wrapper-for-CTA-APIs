This CTA class file is an API wrapper for interfacing with the Chicago Transit Authority's three web-based Application Programming Interfaces for Bus, Train ('El') and Service related information. 

Due to the evolution of the CTA's API interfaces, there are three distinct APIs, one for Bus, Train and Service information. As a result there are three distinct URI endpoints and two distinct API keys. 

This class brings all three APIs together into one object with related methods for accessing Bus, Train and Service information.

However, there is no requirement that both an Bus and Train API key are needed to use this class file. That is while this class file helps to unify the three distinct APIs together for a PHP developer, this class can also be used to interface with just the Bus, Train or Service API and nothing else.  

Thus the initiation of the object is done by simply providing a Bus and/or Train API Key.
